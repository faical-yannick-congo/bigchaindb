The Transaction Model
=====================

A transaction has the following structure:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "id": "<hash of transaction, excluding signatures (see explanation)>",
        "version": "<version number of the transaction model>",
        "inputs": ["<list of inputs>"],
        "outputs": ["<list of outputs>"],
        "operation": "<string>",
        "asset": "<digital asset description (explained in the next section)>",
        "metadata": "<any JSON document>"
    }

Here's some explanation of the contents of a :ref:`transaction <transaction>`:

- id: The :ref:`id <transaction.id>` of the transaction, and also the database primary key.
- version: :ref:`Version <transaction.version>` number of the transaction model, so that software can support different transaction models.
- **inputs**: List of inputs. Each :ref:`input <Input>` contains a pointer to an unspent asset
  and a *crypto fulfillment* that satisfies a spending condition set on the unspent asset. A *fulfillment*
  is usually a signature proving the ownership of the asset.
  See :doc:`./crypto-conditions`.

- **outputs**: List of outputs. Each :ref:`output <Output>` is a *crypto-condition* that needs to be fulfilled by a transfer transaction in order to transfer ownership to new owners.
  See :doc:`./crypto-conditions`.

- **operation**: String representation of the :ref:`operation <transaction.operation>` being performed (currently either "CREATE", "TRANSFER" or "GENESIS"). It determines how the transaction should be validated.

- **asset**: Definition of the digital :ref:`asset <Asset>`. See next section.

- **metadata**: User-provided transaction :ref:`metadata <metadata>`: Can be any JSON document, or `NULL`.

Later, when we get to the models for the block and the vote, we'll see that both include a signature (from the node which created it). You may wonder why transactions don't have signatures... The answer is that they do! They're just hidden inside the ``fulfillment`` string of each input. A creation transaction is signed by whoever created it. A transfer transaction is signed by whoever currently controls or owns it.

What gets signed? For each input in the transaction, the "fullfillment message" that gets signed includes the ``operation``, ``data``, ``version``, ``id``, corresponding ``condition``, and the fulfillment itself, except with its fulfillment string set to ``null``. The computed signature goes into creating the ``fulfillment`` string of the input.
